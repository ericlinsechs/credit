# Credit Card Validator
This program is a simple credit card number validator that determines whether a given credit card number is valid and, if so, identifies the type of card (American Express, Visa, or MasterCard). The validation is done using [Luhn's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm).

It is made for [Harvard Universityâ€™s CS50 course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) [week 1 Problem Set 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/1/credit/) in 2023.
